## Customise Data

All you need to do is update the linksData.js file & add a photo to display.
To find this file => Go to the folder `src => linksData.js`

For Profile image: You ca either use Profile Image URL or static image.

If you want to use URL then place the URL for `profileImagePath` within double quotes.

If you have a static Image then copy that image and paste it inside this folder => `src/assets/profileImage`

Same way fill other data inside the `linksData.js`

In case if you know basics of CSS and want to change the styles then feel free to customise by entering custom color hex code, border radius etc by filling the `styleData`. If you don't fill this and keep it as it is then it will aplly the default styles as given in `preview URL`
